Transfer learning may make training on a particularly distinguishable dataset easier. It enables several elements of a pre-trained model to be used as the foundation of a new model's architecture. More importantly, we can adopt this approach in quantum machine learning as well. In this project, we seek to implement quantum transfer learning using an ImageNet-pre-trained model, which will be used on the PCam dataset to tackle the lymph node metastases detection problem. The pre-trained model is GoogLeNet, and the classifier uses hybrid classical-quantum fully connected layers. Typically, quantum layers are made up of embedding, quantum circuits, and measurement. The embedding and quantum circuits are built upon the QAOA-inspired ansatz and particle-conserving entangler, respectively.
